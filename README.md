## Directions to run this code

My implementation is done using javascript, D3.js, jQuery and moment.js. This code requires no additional libraries other than the ones included in the 'index.html'. Please ensure to use a local webserver while running this code. My implementation has been verified using the LiveServer extension in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Data Handling

I have created a simple JSON to store the materials data. This data can easily be writted to a .json file or .csv file.

## Testing validity of input

I have included in-line functions to test the validity of each input individually.
